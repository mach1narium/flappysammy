Yet another flappy bird clone.

It also works under a http://138.68.89.99:8000 - public IP of my 2 years, never used ubuntu-s-1vcpu-1gb-fra1-01 basic droplet.
I am running a web server there using Pygbag(packager + web server), so when You enter, web browser should run a game in some kind of java script VM, thats why rendering graphics and SFX playback seem slow at times.

Anyway if You have few minutes please help me test out droplet load, and let me know if any bugs...

PS: tested only on chrome and opera browser, works also on android with chrome installed.
